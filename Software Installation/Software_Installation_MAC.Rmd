# Introduction
The following instructions will guide you through installing **R**, **RStudio**, and **LaTeX**. Throughout the program you will be asked to turn in assignments in a pdf format. Using R Markdown (.rmd) files in RStudio will allow you to compile files into a pdf. In an R Markdown file you will be able to show written code, outputs from code (including plots), and write like you would in a word processing document. Once you have installed **R**, **RStudio**, and **LaTeX** open the *RStudio_tutorial.rmd* to test if you can knit the file from .rmd to .pdf. 

It is important to download R, before installing RStudio as all versions of RStudio requires users to have downloaded prior to running RStudio. 

Note: Instructions were written for macOS Mojave. The new version of R is for macOS El Capitan or higher. Please make sure your computer is up to date before installing software.
