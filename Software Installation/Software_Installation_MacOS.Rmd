# Introduction
The following instructions will guide you through installing **R**, **RStudio**, and **LaTeX** (MacTex for Mac). Throughout the program you will be asked to turn in assignments in a pdf format. Using R Markdown (.rmd) files in RStudio will allow you to compile files into a pdf. In an R Markdown file you will be able to show written code, outputs from code (including plots), and write like you would in a word processing document. Once you have installed **R**, **RStudio**, and **LaTeX** (MacTex for Mac)open the *RStudio_tutorial.rmd* to test if you can knit the file from .rmd to .pdf. 

It is important to download R, before installing RStudio as all versions of RStudio requires users to have downloaded prior to running RStudio. 

Note: Instructions were written for macOS Mojave. The new version of R is for macOS El Capitan or higher. Please make sure your computer is up to date before installing software.

    - This package is rather larger (~3.9 Gb) and will approximately 15 minutes (possibly longer) to download. 
    - It is recommended to have your computer charging when downloading large files from the internet. 
    - Do **not** download smaller *BasicTeX* package. You need the entire package for knitr to work properly in RStudio. *BasicTeX* does not install all LaTeX packages which is necessary for knitr to work properly. 
  + Click on the **mactex-20190508.pkg** file to begin the installation process. (Note: this assumes you have macOS Sierra or higher)
    - The installation will require you to have at least 10 Gbs of space on your hard drive. You will also need to enter your password for the installation.
    - When the program finishes installing, click Close and the installer package can be moved to the Trash.
